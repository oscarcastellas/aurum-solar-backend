## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **Real-Time Lead Scoring Algorithm**

**4-Factor Weighted Scoring (100 points total)**:

1. **Base Qualification (40% weight)**:
   - Homeowner status: Required (binary yes/no)
   - Monthly bill amount: $200+ good, $300+ excellent
   - ZIP code quality: Premium NYC areas get bonus points
   - Property type: Single-family > Condo > Co-op

2. **Behavioral Scoring (30% weight)**:
   - Session engagement time: Longer sessions = higher intent
   - Questions asked: Technical questions indicate serious interest
   - Objection handling: Successfully resolved objections = higher quality
   - Response sentiment: Positive sentiment throughout conversation

3. **Market Timing (20% weight)**:
   - 2025 installation timeline: Critical for tax credit urgency
   - Credit indicators: Financing pre-qualification signals
   - Decision-maker status: Primary vs. influencer vs. researcher
   - Competition awareness: Comparison shopping behavior

4. **NYC Market Intelligence (10% weight)**:
   - Borough solar adoption rates
   - Neighborhood income demographics
   - Local installer availability and demand
   - Seasonal installation factors

- Time-of-day pricing (10-20% premium during business hours)
- Day-of-week pricing (Weekend discounts, weekday premiums)
- Market-specific adjustments (NYC premium, neighborhood bonuses)

**Routing Optimization**:
- Route to highest-paying available buyers
- Consider buyer capacity and acceptance rates
- Geographic preference matching
- Lead quality to buyer tier alignment
- Revenue potential maximization

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Scoring Algorithm Enhancement**

**Before (Basic Scoring)**:
```python
lead_score = base_qualification_score * 0.6 + behavioral_score * 0.4
```

**After (Revenue-Optimized Scoring)**:
```python
lead_score = (
    base_qualification_score * 0.40 +
    behavioral_score * 0.30 +
    market_timing_score * 0.20 +
    nyc_intelligence_score * 0.10
)

# Apply market adjustments
revenue_potential = base_revenue * quality_multiplier * surge_multiplier * market_multiplier
```

### **B2B Buyer Routing Logic**

```python
# Calculate routing score for each buyer
routing_score = (
    expected_revenue * 0.4 +           # Revenue potential
    acceptance_rate * 100 * 0.25 +     # Acceptance rate
    (1.0 - utilization) * 100 * 0.15 + # Available capacity
    quality_match_score * 0.1 +        # Quality alignment
    geographic_match_score * 0.05 +    # Geographic preference
    historical_performance * 0.05      # Past performance
)

# Route to highest scoring buyer
selected_buyer = max(routing_options, key=lambda x: x["routing_score"])
```

### **Revenue Optimization Integration**

```python
# Process conversation with revenue optimization
response = await revenue_optimization_system.process_conversation_for_revenue_optimization(
    session_id="chat_1234567890",
    message="I'm interested in solar for my co-op in Manhattan",
    conversation_context={
        "homeowner_verified": True,
        "bill_amount": 400.0,
        "zip_code": "10021",
        "borough": "manhattan"
    },
    conversation_history=conversation_history
)

# Response includes:
# - AI-generated content
# - Real-time lead scoring
# - Revenue potential calculation
# - Optimization recommendations
# - B2B routing decision (if ready)
```
