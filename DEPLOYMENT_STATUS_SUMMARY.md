## 🔧 **MANUAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Initialize Railway project
railway init
# Select "Create new project"
# Name: aurum-solar-backend

# Add database services
railway add postgresql
railway add redis

# Set environment variables
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT=production
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://aurum-solar.vercel.app
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key

# Deploy backend
railway up --detach

# Get backend URL
railway domain
# Copy the URL (e.g., https://aurum-solar-backend.railway.app)
```

### **Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd aurum-chat-solar-main

# Initialize Vercel project
vercel
# Select "Set up and deploy"
# Project name: aurum-solar-frontend

# Set environment variables
vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# Enter your Railway backend URL

vercel env add VITE_WS_URL production
# Enter WebSocket URL (wss://your-backend-url)

vercel env add VITE_APP_NAME production
# Enter: Aurum Solar

# Deploy frontend
vercel --prod
```

### **Step 3: Update Backend CORS**

```bash
cd backend
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
railway up --detach
```

### **Step 4: Validate Deployment**

```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health

# Test frontend
curl https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app

# Run validation script
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app ./scripts/validate-production.sh
```
