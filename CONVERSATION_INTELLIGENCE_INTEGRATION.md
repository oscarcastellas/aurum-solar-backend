## üéØ **Key Features**

### **Proactive Qualification Engine**

**Intelligent Question Sequencing**:
```python
# High-impact qualification sequence
1. Homeowner status (1.5x value impact)
2. Bill amount (1.3x value impact) 
3. Credit signals (1.2x value impact)
4. Timeline urgency (1.1x value impact)
5. Technical engagement (1.1x value impact)
```

**Dynamic Adaptation**:
- Recognizes high-intent signals and accelerates qualification
- Handles qualification gaps without feeling interrogative
- Adjusts conversation based on lead scoring progress

### **Technical Expertise Engine**

**NYC-Specific Knowledge**:
- **Co-op board approval** - 85% success rate, 2-4 week timeline
- **Roof challenges** - Flat roofs, historic restrictions, structural concerns
- **Permit process** - NYC DOB, Con Edison interconnection, inspections
- **Financing options** - Solar loans, leases, PPAs with NYC-specific rates
- **Warranty details** - 25-year panel, 12-year inverter, 10-year workmanship

**Authoritative Responses**:
```
"Co-op boards typically require architectural review, insurance certificates, and contractor approval. We've successfully installed solar in over 200 co-ops across NYC with an 85% approval rate. Our team handles all the paperwork, including architectural plans and contractor certifications."
```

### **Objection Handling Expert**

**Data-Driven Responses**:

**Cost Objections**:
```
"Let me show you the real numbers. With the 30% federal tax credit, 25% NYSERDA rebate, and NYC property tax abatement, your $20,000 system costs only $8,500 out of pocket. You'll save $3,200 annually, so you break even in 2.6 years and save $45,000 over 25 years."
```

**Roof Concerns**:
```
"Our certified installers have completed over 500 installations on {roof_type} roofs in NYC. We recently installed a 7.2kW system on a similar {roof_type} roof in {neighborhood} that's producing 9,800 kWh annually, saving the homeowner $3,100 per year."
```

**Process Complexity**:
```
"Don't worry about the permit process - we handle everything. Our team files all required permits with the NYC Department of Buildings and Con Edison. The entire process takes 6-8 weeks, and we coordinate all inspections."
```

### **Urgency Creation Engine**

**Deadline Messaging**:
- **2025 Federal Tax Credit** - 30% expires December 31st, drops to 26% in 2026
- **NYSERDA Rebate** - Declining block structure, limited funding
- **Peak Installation Season** - Spring optimal for summer savings
- **Installer Availability** - Limited slots due to high demand

**Scarcity Tactics**:
```
"The 30% federal tax credit expires December 31st, 2025 - that's only 347 days away! After December 31st, the federal credit drops to 26% in 2026 and 22% in 2027. That's a $6,000 difference on a $20,000 system."
```

### **Conversation Personalization Engine**

**Neighborhood-Specific Examples**:

**Park Slope**:
```
"Homeowners in Park Slope typically save $2,800+ annually with solar. We recently installed a 7.2kW system on a brownstone that's saving $267 monthly. The panels blend perfectly with the historic architecture."
```

**Upper East Side**:
```
"With Con Ed rates at 31¬¢/kWh, solar ROI is excellent in your area. We've successfully navigated co-op board approvals in 85% of cases, including several buildings near Central Park."
```

**DUMBO**:
```
"Perfect for your industrial space! We recently completed a 6.8kW installation on a similar loft that's producing 9,200 kWh annually. The hurricane-rated panels are ideal for the waterfront location."
```
